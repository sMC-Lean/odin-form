# odin-form

build a sign up form to practice styling and client side validation;

build a form styling according to a supplied image and instructions.
this project brief asked us to ignore mobile layout and JS validation for now,
it was more about learning to use html5 validation methods and syling elements.

I did work on making the layout responsive and so it should scale for small displays.
validation is only client side per the project brief, no JS at this stage.
minimised the visual impact of the valid and invalid prompts and only provide minimal feedback.

basic pattern matching used for this project, passwords do not need to match each other per the brief.
